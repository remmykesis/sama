# Samasource Solutions/Customer Success Engineering Excercise
At Samasource we provide [training data](https://www.samasource.com/blog/2017/12/18/what-is-training-data) for computer vision models.  Whether we're dealing with [image annotation applications](https://www.samasource.com/blog/2018/12/04/training-your-ai-in-3d), metrics to benchmark how well our services are performed, or tools to help integrate customer data pipelines, reporting and working  with images is part of our DNA.   

## Exercise 1 (Architecture & Design)
We anticipate this exercise should take about a couple hours.  We're more interested in your approach than perfection.  

Write a program in Python that takes in a json(sample-json.json), outputs and generates the following:

- Number of unique shape types
- Frequency of each shape and all labels associated with the shapes (for e.g. line - 'middle line': 445)
- Create two different png/jpegs that visualizes the shapes i) colors are based on shape types ii) colors are based on annotation label. Checkout 3 sets of samples, Question 1 Example Images.
The dimensions of the original image were: 3840 × 2160

## Exercise 2 (Code review and Bug fix)

The python script is used to identify corrupt images. But the user reports that the script is running incorrectly, they are not sure what is causing the error. 
Given the python script and 1 sample corrupt image (indexed_5d5da9038aa716043cb777f4_0e2ee618-dab5-48c1-b13f-13ca3f8326e6.png), can you please diagnose what the error(s) are and fix the errors?

## Branch this repository and submit your answer as a pull request.  Please include a README that explains how to clone and run your solutions.  

## Followup

Be prepared to present your solution in a followup video call in a 3-5 slide presentation.  We'd like to hear how you approached the problem and why, the challenges encountered and how you worked through them.
